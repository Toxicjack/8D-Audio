# 8D Audio Processor

## Overview
The 8D Audio Processor is an application designed to enhance audio experiences by adding 8D sound effects. This project allows users to listen to music and other audio files with immersive 8D sound effects.

## Features
- **8D Sound Effect**: Experience audio in an immersive 8D environment.
- **Real-time Audio Processing**: Process live audio input from your microphone.
- **Audio File Processing**: Process audio files from your local system.
